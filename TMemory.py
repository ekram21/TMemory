Library which will store variables during run time in text files for long duration.
Can be used as volatile or permanent memory. Mainly needed as a way of communicating between
external scripts and pass around variables since python cant access permanent memory locations
easily. 

Alternatives to this library with faster fetch times but more complexity:
    -pickle
    -sqlite3
    -json
    -weakref
    -shelve

Use the above if optimization and response time is very important along with memory space.
Otherwise this library will get the job done
